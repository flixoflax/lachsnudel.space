A hub for small tools I build for us — disguised as a 1950s UFO conspiracy tabloid.

## The Story

Two Berliners (N. and F.) claim to have witnessed an Unidentified Pasta Object over Berlin. Since the encounter, they feel compelled to cook the same dish every few weeks: tagliatelle with salmon and dill — Lachsnudeln.

The "contactees" have also begun building devices. Tools to stay connected across distances. The transmissions are documented here.

## Devices

| Device                                               | What it actually does                                                   |

More schematics incoming.
